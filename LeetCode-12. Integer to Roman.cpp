// 12. Integer to Roman-Medium

// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000
// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. 
// The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. 
// Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, 
// which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

// I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
// X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
// C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
// Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: num = 3
// Output: "III"
// Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
// Example 2:

// Input: num = 58
// Output: "LVIII"
// Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
// Example 3:

// Input: num = 1994
// Output: "MCMXCIV"
// Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= num <= 3999
